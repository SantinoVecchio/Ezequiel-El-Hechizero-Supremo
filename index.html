                <h3>
                    In the oldest registers of forbidden grimoires, scattered between burned pages and half-forgotten
                    parchments, one name emerges with unsettling frequency: Ezequiel, the Sorcerer Supreme. His
                    reputation was not merely built upon sorcery, but upon a mastery of knowledge and strategy so
                    profound that those who witnessed it spoke of him as if he were more than a man.
                </h3>

            <p>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter II – The Dual Craft</h1>
            <h3>
                Ezequiel’s art was twofold. He was a conjurer, one who spoke with shadows and summoned fire and silence
                alike. But he was also a tactician, whose arena was not only the battlefield of wizards but the tabletop
                of a game that mirrored the eternal struggle of gods and mortals: Magic: The Gathering.
                Within the shifting decks of spells and creatures, he discerned patterns unseen by others. Each card in
                his hand was not a mere game piece, but a living rune, a fragment of truth that only he could read.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter III – Playing Against Fate</h1>
            <h3>
                Those who dared face him confessed afterward that Ezequiel was not playing against them, but against
                fate itself. His eyes did not look at his cards — they pierced through them, beyond the veil of the
                moment, as though he had already glimpsed the outcome before the first turn began.
                When he laid down a spell, the air grew heavy, charged with an electricity that smelled faintly of ozone
                and ash.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter IV – The Primeval Companion</h1>
            <h3>
                What elevated Ezequiel above all others was not only his mastery, but the presence of a companion so
                ancient that even the bravest chroniclers hesitated to name it: Progenitus.
                This colossal being, whispered of as “the primeval origin,” was no mere creature on a card. To Ezequiel,
                Progenitus was a guardian spirit, a living testament to creation and destruction entwined. In matches,
                its appearance shook reality itself. Opponents fell into silence, struck by dread at the idea that such
                a beast could be summoned at will.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter V – The Chamber of Study</h1>
            <h3>
                Legends tell of his chamber — a dim room lined with towering shelves, where dust and candlelight danced.
                Ancient scrolls lay beside worn decks of cards. Crimson candles flickered on a blackened desk, their wax
                dripping like blood into copper bowls.
                Here, night after night, Ezequiel trained not just his hand but his spirit. Every game was a ritual.
                Every move, a chant. Every victory, a prophecy fulfilled.
            </h3>

            <p>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter VI – Whispers of the Beast</h1>
            <h3>
                Travelers described Ezequiel with awe. Some called him a patient scholar, others a warlock whose silence
                commanded obedience. A few whispered that Progenitus itself was not bound to fantasy — that on rare
                nights, beneath a blood moon, the shadow of something vast and serpentine coiled behind him, watching,
                waiting.
            </h3>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter VII – A Legend in Two Worlds</h1>
            <h3>
                Thus, he became a legend whispered across realms. Among sorcerers, a master of forbidden arts. Among
                players, an opponent who bent the very flow of the game.
                Those who faced him left haunted — not by defeat, but by the realization they had glimpsed something
                larger, something cosmic, as though the table had become a portal to worlds unseen.
            </h3>

            <p>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Chapter VIII – The Eternal Echo</h1>
            <h3>
                To this day, the chronicles speak of him with reverence and unease. His story is not of pastime but of
                communion with the arcane. To summon Progenitus was not to win, but to remind mortals that primordial
                forces still breathe among us.
                And when the cards are shuffled, some players swear they feel a whisper in the silence of the game:
                “Ezequiel, the Sorcerer Supreme.”
